#Overall data
The data is about smoking and lung cancer status. It includes people of different age groups, different genders and whether they have lung cancer or not. And, the dataset also includes different information such as anxiety level, severity of smoking, and even peer pressure.

#Code
Based on the data, I presented an age distribution chart to better visualize the age differences. I also plotted the linear relationship between age and lung cancer, smoking and lung cancer.
